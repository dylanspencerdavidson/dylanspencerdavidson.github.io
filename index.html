        <h2>Hello dear beautiful human beings! </br></br>This is the Training Center for CFCL Vol. 11</br>at Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2026</br></br>
            We are very happy to be with you today :) </br>

        <h3>üë£ Walking</h3>
        <img src="walking-path.jpg" width="100%">
        <p style="text-align: left;"> <p>The overall walk should feel light and smooth.</br></br>
            The beginning music may feel a little slow, but keep your tempo steady ‚Äî follow the rhythm as it flows. Think of lightness ‚Äî as if you can feel the wind around you.
            Imagine you are on your way to the cinema with your friends ‚Äî you‚Äôre looking forward to meeting them, feeling calm and at ease. Along the path, you may pass a musician ‚Äî if so, shift your path smoothly, keeping the motion natural and relaxed. There‚Äôs no rush, no stiffness ‚Äî let your body move with ease. </br></br>At the corners, don‚Äôt make them sharp ‚Äî take them softly and fluidly, with graceful continuity.
            As the show moves forward, the piano music becomes stronger ‚Äî try to capture that strength in your walk. Let your presence grow ‚Äî your posture taller, your movements more elegant and assured. In the last half, you become even more composed and refined, carrying a quiet sense of confidence and power. Maintain a micro smile, subtle but sincere. You are elegant, light, and present ‚Äî moving as if the air itself is guiding you.</p>
            <!-- ‚Ä¢  Walk independently of the music, so don't let your walk be affected by the tempo and vibe of the music.  -->
        <p>During the finale, make sure the gap between you and the models in front and behind you stays tight!</p>

        <h3>‚ùÑÔ∏è Atmosphere and mood</h3>
        <p>The show is being presented at La Ga√Æt√© Lyrique, a French digital arts and modern music centre. The atmosphere for the show is like a rehearsal, as if you're preparing backstage for a big concert.</p>
        <h3>üéº About the music</h3>
        <p>The music is by TLF Trio, an experimental chamber music ensemble consisting of cellist C√¶cilie Trier, pianist Jakob Littauer and guitarist M. K. Fr√∏slev. Their latest album "Desire" was released last month on the label <i>15 love</i>. Have a listen to these excerpts before the show so you know what to expect:</p>

        <h3>ü™° Collection</h3>
        <p>
            The modest garments of CFCL, dened as tools for daily life, refrain from overtly expressing the creator‚Äôs inspirations.
Instead, we commit with steady persistence to a singular purpose: creating clothing for contemporary life.
Within the ow of everyday urban life, we aim to create a presence that can oer a quiet yet rich sense of awareness,

one that allows us to notice the subtle shis of the seasons,
the depth of history around us, and the thoughtfulness of those nearby.
‚ÄúWe want to produce like a plant that produces a fruit and not to reproduce.
We want to produce directly and not through interpretation.‚Äù wrote Jean Arp in 1944,
articulating the founding principles of Concrete Art, a movement that continues to resonate deeply with us.

Inspired by this sensibility, CFCL‚Äôs VOL.11 collection came into being.
CFCL continues to cultivate a new form of Knit-ware that is tangible but not derivative,
brought to life through materials reecting a transparent and contemporary perspective.</p>
